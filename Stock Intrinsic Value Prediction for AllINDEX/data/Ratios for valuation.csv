Quarterly Revenue Growth,Quarterly Revenue (final - initial),Quarterly revenue growth is an increase in a company's sales in one quarter compared to sales of a different quarter.
Earnings per share (EPS),(Net Income - Preferred Dividendes) / Outstanding Common Share,Ratio of Earnings divided by number of shares of the listed company
Return on asset (ROA),NetIncome/TotalAssets,"Investors can use ROA to determine how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate a profit.
The metric is commonly expressed as a percentage by using a company's net income and its average assets. A higher ROA means a company is more efficient and productive at managing its balance sheet to generate profits while a lower ROA indicates there is room for improvement"
Return on equity (ROE),NetIncome / NetIncomeApplicableToCommonShares,"ROE is considered a gauge of a corporation's profitability and how efficient it is in generating profits. The higher the ROE, the more efficient a company's management is at generating income and growth"
Price to earnings (P/E) ratio,MarketValuePerShare/EarningPerShare,"The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple.
P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison to others in the same sector. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time."
Price to sales (P/S) ratio,MarketValuePerShare/SalesPerShare,The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a valuation ratio that compares a company’s stock price to its revenues. It is an indicator of the value that financial markets have placed on each dollar of a company’s sales or revenues.
Net profit margin,netIncome/totalRevenue,"The net profit margin, or simply net margin, measures how much net income or profit is generated as a percentage of revenue.
Net profit margin is typically expressed as a percentage but can also be represented in decimal form. The net profit margin illustrates how much of each dollar in revenue collected by a company translates into profit."
Gross profit margin,grossProfit/totalRevenue,A company's gross profit margin is the money it makes after accounting for the cost of doing business. This metric is commonly expressed as a percentage of sales and may also be known as the gross margin ratio.
Operating margin,OpeartionIncome / TotalRevenue,"It is calculated by dividing a company’s operating income by its net sales. Higher ratios are generally better, illustrating the company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits. "
Price to book (P/B) ratio,MarketValuePerShare/BookPerShare,"Investors use the price-to-book value to gauge whether a stock is valued properly. A P/B ratio of one means that the stock price is trading in line with the book value of the company. In other words, the stock price would be considered fairly valued, strictly from a P/B standpoint. A company with a high P/B ratio could mean the stock price is overvalued, while a company with a lower P/B could be undervalued"
Price to cash flow ratio,SharePrice/OperatingCashFlowPerShare,"The P/CF ratio is said to be a better investment valuation indicator than the P/E ratio because cash flows cannot be manipulated as easily as earnings, which are affected by accounting treatment for items such as depreciation and other non-cash charges. Some companies may appear unprofitable because of large non-cash expenses, for example, even though they have positive cash flows."
Cash ratio,Cash And Equivalents/ TotalCurrentLiabilities,"A cash ratio is expressed as a numeral, greater or less than 1. Upon calculating the ratio, if the result is equal to 1, the company has exactly the same amount of current liabilities as it does cash and cash equivalents to pay off those debts.
The cash ratio is almost like an indicator of a firm’s value under the worst-case scenario—say, where the company is about to go out of business. It tells creditors and analysts the value of current assets that could quickly be turned into cash, and what percentage of the company’s current liabilities these cash and near-cash assets could cover."
Enterprise multiple,(Market capitalization + total debt−cash + cash equivalents) / EBITDA,"EV includes in its calculation the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt and any cash or cash equivalents on the company's balance sheet. Enterprise value (EV) differs significantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it to be a more accurate representation of a firm's value. EV tells investors or interested parties a company's value and how much another company would need if it wanted to purchase that company.
There is one other consideration: a company's EV can be negative if the total value of its cash and cash equivalents surpasses that of the combined total of its market cap and debts. This is a sign that a company is not using its assets very well—it has too much cash sitting around not being used. Extra cash can be used for many things, such as distributions, buybacks, expansion, research and development, maintenance, employee pay raises, bonuses, or paying off debts."
Enterprise value/cash flow from operations,Enterprise value/cash flow from operations,"Enterprise Value to Cash from Operations (EV/CFO) is an important ratio to assess a company’s cash flow buffer in comparison with its enterprise value. In other words, the ratio helps us in understanding how long it will take the company to acquire existing shares and pay off outstanding obligations, using its operating cash flows.  The estimation of the same requires two main variables: Enterprise Value and Cash from Operations. A higher EV/ Cash from Operations multiple indicates that the firm is likely to be overpriced, while a lower EV/ Cash from Operations multiple indicates that the company is undervalued. In general, the lower the EV-to- Cash from Operations ratio, the more appealing is the firm for investment whereas, a lower EV-to-Cash from Operations ratio indicates that a stock is undervalued."
Debt to equity ratio,shortLongTermDebtTotal/totalStockholderEquity,"The debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) is a financial leverage ratio that can be helpful when attempting to understand a company's economic health and if an investment is worthwhile or not. It is considered to be a gearing ratio that compares the owner's equity or capital to debt, or funds borrowed by the company. Because debt is inherently risky, lenders and investors tend to favor businesses with lower D/E ratios. For lenders, a low ratio means a lower risk of loan default. For shareholders, it means a decreased probability of bankruptcy in the event of an economic downturn. A company with a higher ratio than its industry average, therefore, may have difficulty securing additional funding from either source."
Quick ratio,(Current Asset - Inventory) / Total Current Libilities,"The quick ratio is an indicator of a company’s short-term liquidity position and measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.
Since it indicates the company’s ability to instantly use its near-cash assets (assets that can be converted quickly to cash) to pay down its current liabilities, it is also called the acid test ratio. An ""acid test"" is a slang term for a quick test designed to produce instant results. A result of 1 is considered to be the normal quick ratio. It indicates that the company is fully equipped with exactly enough assets to be instantly liquidated to pay off its current liabilities. A company that has a quick ratio of less than 1 may not be able to fully pay off its current liabilities in the short term, while a company having a quick ratio higher than 1 can instantly get rid of its current liabilities. For instance, a quick ratio of 1.5 indicates that a company has $1.50 of liquid assets available to cover each $1 of its current liabilities."
Days sales of inventory (DSI),(Inventory / Cost of Sales) x (No. of Days in the Period),"The days sales of inventory (DSI) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time in days that a company takes to turn its inventory, including goods that are a work in progress, into sales.
DSI is also known as the average age of inventory, days inventory outstanding (DIO), days in inventory (DII), days sales in inventory, or days inventory and is interpreted in multiple ways. Indicating the liquidity of the inventory, the figure represents how many days a company’s current stock of inventory will last. Generally, a lower DSI is preferred as it indicates a shorter duration to clear off the inventory, though the average DSI varies from one industry to another."
Days payable of outstanding,number_of_days x (accountsPayable/costOfRevenue),"Days payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time (in days) that a company takes to pay its bills and invoices to its trade creditors, which may include suppliers, vendors, or financiers. The ratio is typically calculated on a quarterly or annual basis, and it indicates how well the company’s cash outflows are being managed.
A company with a higher value of DPO takes longer to pay its bills, which means that it can retain available funds for a longer duration, allowing the company an opportunity to use those funds in a better way to maximize the benefits. A high DPO, however, may also be a red flag indicating an inability to pay its bills on time."
Long term debt to total assets,longTermDebtTotal/totalAssets,"The long-term debt-to-total-assets ratio is a measurement representing the percentage of a corporation's assets financed with long-term debt, which encompasses loans or other debt obligations lasting more than one year. This ratio provides a general measure of the long-term financial position of a company, including its ability to meet its financial obligations for outstanding loans."
Working capital ratio,totalCurrentAssets/totalCurrentLiabilities,"The working capital ratio is a very basic metric of liquidity. It is meant to indicate how capable a company is of meeting its current financial obligations and is a measure of a company's basic financial solvency. In determining working capital, also known as net working capital, or the working capital ratio, companies rely on the current assets and current liabilities figures found on their financial statements or balance sheets.The ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. It is also referred to as the current ratio.
Generally, a working capital ratio of less than one is taken as indicative of potential future liquidity problems, while a ratio of 1.5 to two is interpreted as indicating a company is on the solid financial ground in terms of liquidity.
An increasingly higher ratio above two is not necessarily considered to be better. A substantially higher ratio can indicate that a company is not doing a good job of employing its assets to generate the maximum possible revenue. A disproportionately high working capital ratio is reflected in an unfavorable return on assets ratio (ROA), one of the primary profitability ratios used to evaluate companies."
