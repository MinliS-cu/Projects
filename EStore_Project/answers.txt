Answers to exercises G1--G3:
G1:
This command search all files contains "smutex" in current directory recursively.
Binary file ./build/sthread.o matches
Binary file ./build/estoresim matches
./sthread.h:typedef pthread_mutex_t smutex_t;
./sthread.h:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex);

G2: grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp         

grep -r "return" --include=\*.h ./     

G3:
This return functions begin with "smutex" .
It will give us where I have init, destroy, lock and unlock the smutes.

Extra credit exercise(s) (describe what you coded):
Exercise 8. 9
For exercise 8, I suppose we need to wait if we cannot brought in case 
1. the item is not valid yet // this case could be envoke or cancel from buyManyItems method
2. the item quantity is not enough yet
3. the budget is not enough yet

For exercise 9 
create a const to keep discount rate and shipping cost in each order
